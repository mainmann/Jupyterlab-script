# JupyterLab Script

I had to activate environment + JupyterLab also jupyterlab startup command opens tab automatically where i dont want, sometimes i forget the headless command, All that combines to this simple script.
   
Make it executable then run as below
```bash
chmod +x jupyterlab_brave.sh
./jupyterlab_brave.sh
```
